    "### Token embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is mainly used for words, so it is also known as **word embeddings**. Whereas the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are binary, sparse, and very high-dimensional (same dimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary), word embeddings are low-dimensional floating-point vectors: that is, dense vectors, as opposed to sparse vectors. So, word embeddings pack more information into far fewer dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to obtain word embeddings: **learn word embeddings** jointly with the main task you care about, and load **pretrained word embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to associate a dense vector with a word is to choose the vector at random. The problem with this approach is that the resulting embedding space has no structure. Something more useful would be to have a space in which the geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Then, word embeddings are meant to map human language into a geometric space. \n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world word-embedding spaces, common examples of meaningful geometric transformations are **gender** vectors and **plural** vectors. For instance, by adding a `female` vector to the vector `king`, we obtain the vector `queen`. By adding a `plural` vector, we obtain `kings`.Word-embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning a word embedding of a particular task is equivalent to training an extra layer of a neural network, which is known as the `Embedding` layer. This layer can be understood as a dictionary that maps integer indices (which stand for specific words) to dense vectors. It takes integers as input, it looks up these integers in an internal dictionary, and it returns the associated vectors. By the way, this layer needs to be told, at least, the size of the vocabulary we are working with and the dimensionality of the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this works, let us implement a classifiers that predicts if a movie review is *positive* or *negative*. The data we will work with is the **IMDB** database that is already included in `keras`. For now, let us import the data limiting the number of the most frequent words we will handle (`max_features`), and also truncating the reviews so that they have twenty words at most (`maxlen`)."

Word2vec captures specific semantic properties, such as gender.\n",

Another popular one is called **Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe)**, which was developed by Stanford researchers in 2014.

Its developers have made available precomputed embeddings for millions of English tokens, obtained from Wikipedia data and Common Crawl data.\n",
